#Week 2

## 02/03/2021

Yesterday we started the second week.
Our new goal is to load the IMDb database into ElasticSearch and make searches from our application.
The rest of the day I was able to read the file (damn, it's big) and call to ES for the indexing.

It. Was. Slow. It would take me like 35h to process the whole document.
So I did stop the processing and today I will make the bulk indexing that we were projected to implement too.
