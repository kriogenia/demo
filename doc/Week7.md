##Week 7

#2021-04-05
My first day at the office and it's a day I don't have much to do at first.
We'll have our usual monday meetings and there's also a responsive web seminar I'll be attending.
Until then, I think I'll be giving a look to my code searching for improvements.

Three meeting later I started looking into our new assignments.
I've half of them already done so first all be returning the whole number of buckets on the aggregations

We agreed on how to handle the missing genres, we'll not even return them on the aggregation. 
I'll be jumping on the definitive change to the genres omitting the \N on the index.
