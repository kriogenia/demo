My first day at the office and it's a day I don't have much to do at first.
We'll have our usual monday meetings and there's also a responsive web seminar I'll be attending.
Until then, I think I'll be giving a look to my code searching for improvements.

Three meeting later I started looking into our new assignments.
I've half of them already done so first all be returning the whole number of buckets on the aggregations
