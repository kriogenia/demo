#Week 8

#2021-04-12
Today we had some meetings, and we showed our current progress alongside the front path.
Then we decided some possible improvements to make.
Changing the aggregation order was the first I decided to make.

I'll start making the new tests for the ordering.
Next step was be making the filters apply to other aggregations even if they are applied too.

It was fairly easy, so I dedicated the rest of the day to the SteamJoy project.
