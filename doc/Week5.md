#Week 5

##2021-03-22
Today I made a shy approach to the ImdbSearcher tests mocking the SearchEngine.
I didn't work as I intended but making some changes I was able to make it work.

Our path meeting today won't happen so instead of a new extension we had to make some deployment tutorial.
The front-end folks will use our APIs to their front pages, so they should be able to easily use them.

My indexing broke, and I still don't know why, some bean problem with the client of ElasticSearch.
So I decided to finally move the indexing to a controller, so it's easier to use.

We had our weekly meeting and strong part is coming, we are starting with the scores.
That means thinking about all the fields, how to evaluate them, adding a new index...
This week looks tough but pretty funny.
