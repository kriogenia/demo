#Week 5

##2021-03-22
Today I made a shy approach to the ImdbSearcher tests mocking the SearchEngine.
I didn't work as I intended but making some changes I was able to make it work.

Our path meeting today won't happen so instead of a new extension we had to make some deployment tutorial.
The front-end folks will use our APIs to their front pages, so they should be able to easily use them.
