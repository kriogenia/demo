#Week 6

##2021-03-09
Today we had three meetings.
First, a common Academy meeting, nothing special.
Then, we meet the search team to review how we did our scores of the previous week.
And last, we meet with the front team to know the next steps.
I'll be working with Raúl, so his front will display my search and the search of María.

This week our work will be to have the same outcome of the searches and work with Raúl to make the integration.
So we exchanged some info and repos and then I went to finish my queries implementation.

I also did add the ratings and votes to the request to follow closely their implementation.
